Al,A4,Not classifiable as a human carcinogen.
Si,,May cause eye irritation. May cause skin irritation. May cause respiratory tract irritation.
P,Group D,Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity
S,,"When administered orally, sulfur reportedly has a laxative or cathartic effect.May cause irritation of skin, mucous membranes."
Cl,A4,Not classifiable as a human carcinogen.
Ar,,Contact with the liquid will cause frostbite.
K,, Harmful Effects and Symptoms Short Term Exposure: Potassium can affect you when breathed in. Direct contact with metal may be corrosive and cause skin and eye burns
Ca,,SOLID MATERIAL WILL CAUSE SKIN & EYE BURNS SINCE IT REACTS WITH MOISTURE TO FORM CAUSTIC.
Sc*,,"Chronic effects due to antimony are alterations of the ECG, especially T-wave abnormalities, myocardial changes, pneumoconiosis, but also pneumonitis, tracheitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, pustular skin eruptions called antimony spots, and contact allergy to the metal."
Ti,,There is no evidence thattitanium is carcinogenic in humans
V,,"The toxicity of vanadium alloys may depend upon other components in the alloy.Potential symptoms of overexposure to dust or fumes are irritation of eyes, skin, throat"
Cr,A4,Not classifiable as a human carcinogen. 
Mn,,"In its acute form, manganese poisoning has the effect, characteristic of other heavy metals if /dust or fume is/ inhaled in sufficient quantity, of producing ""metal fume fever""."
Fe,,"As little as 1 to 2 g of iron may cause death, but 2 to 10 g is usually ingested in fatal cases."
Co,A3, Confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans.
Ni,A5,human carcinogen. BASIS FOR CLASSIFICATION: Human data in which exposure to nickelrefinery dust caused lung and nasal tumors in sulfide nickel matte refinery workers in several epidemiologic studies in different countries and on animal data in which carcinomas were produced in rats by inhalation and injection. HUMAN CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Sufficient.
Cu,Group D,Not classifiable as a human carcinogen.
Zn,Group D,Not classifiable as a human carcinogen.
Ga,,"It has a metallic taste, causes dermatitis & depression of bone marrow function."
Ge,,"GERMANIUM IS NOT CONSIDERED AN INDUSTRIAL HEALTH HAZARD; ACCIDENTAL POISONINGS IN HUMANS ARE RARE, IN SPITE OF EXPOSURE TO APPRECIABLE AMT OF GERMANIUM IN FOODS & FLUE DUST, & IN ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY."
As,A1,Confirmed human carcinogen. 
Se, Group D, Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity
Br,,"Dermal: There is a rare cutaneous manifestation of bromide accumulation known as bromoderma tuberosum, which progresses from red papules to pustules that enlarge and develop into indurated lesions with a central ulcer. This effect is related to the ingestion of bromides formerly used in medications and, in theory, to chronic inhalation of low-level concentrations of bromine."
Rb,,There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of strontium-90.
Sr,,"Although these metals have been used for an appreciable amount of time in industrial settings, no detectable signs of human toxicity have been reported."
Y,,"Although these metals have been used for an appreciable amount of time in industrial settings, no detectable signs of human toxicity have been reported."
Zr,A4,"Not classifiable as a human carcinogen. /Zirconium and cmpd,"
Nb,,
Mo,,"Metallic and poorly soluble molybdenum compounds (such as molybdenum disulfide,molybdenum dioxide) have limited animal experimental data and no human toxicity data. "
Cs,,No specific range of toxicity can be established for thebroad field of chemicals in general.
Ba,A4, Not classifiable as a human carcinogen. 
Ta,,"No specific range of toxicity can be established for the
       broad field of chemicals in general."
W,,A specific minimum toxic dose has not been established.
Pb,A3,Confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans. 
Th,,There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of mixed alpha-particle emitters 
U,A1, Confirmed human carcinogen.
